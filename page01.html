    <h4>The Game Where You Don't Need to Fight</h4>
    <article>Game Synopsis:
      Long ago, in the year of 201X, two races ruled over the earth: Humans and Monsters. However, a terrible war broke out between the two races, and after a long battle the humans were victorious. The monsters were forced to retreat into the Underground of Mount Ebott, and the humans sealed them within the Underground with a magical barrier. Many years later, legends say that humans who climb Mount Ebott never return.

      Gameplay:
      The player plays as a human child who has fallen into the Underground. As they venture into the unknown world in search of a way back to the surface, the player meets various monsters, many of which engage the player in a fight. The combat system involves the player navigating through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent, and fighting style differs depending on what character engages in a fight with you. However, the player has the option to pacify and spare the monsters or kill them instead. Whatever path you choose will greatly affect the playerâ€™s progression in the game; and it may change the dialogue, characters, and story based on outcomes. This game may as well be a reflection on your soul.</article>
