    <article>Game Synopsis:
      Game Synopsis:
      College dropout Mae Borowski returns home to the crumbling former mining town of Possum Springs seeking to resume her aimless former life and reconnect with the friends she left behind. But things aren't the same. Home seems different now and her friends have grown and changed. Leaves are falling and the wind is growing colder. Strange things are happening as the light fades. And there's something in the woods.

      Gameplay:
      The player spends the entirety of the game chatting with the various characters around Possum Springs. The dialogue is really what matters most, but the exploration of Mae’s hometown still gets broken up with a series of minigames. Every minigame is embedded into the narrative of the story and adapts to the player’s choices as they progress. Their sole purpose is to build upon the story narrative and the characters you frequently encounter throughout the game–rather than being their own game experience. Which allows players to become more connected to the main character and her friends. Players may find their stories more relatable than they think.
